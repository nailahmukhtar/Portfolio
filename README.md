# Portfolio

## Description 

### Purpose
Build a portfolio website to showcase the work I can do. I built this with a view to showcasing the skills I have learnt so far, mainly flexbox and chaining css selectors to apply specific stylings.

### What I did
    - When the page is loaded the website presents:
		- my name
		- an avatar
		- links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
	- When the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
	- When viewing the section about my work, the section contains titled images of my applications, displayed using flexbox
	- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application/ placeholders for now.
	- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
